# SchoologyGreen
A custom CSS thing for the Schoology Student dashboard

**How do I use it?**

1. Download any browser addon that will let you inject custom CSS ( I use [Stylebot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylebot-web/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), but anything *should* work)
2. Inject the following code:

```css
@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kc5f/SchoologyGreen/main/main.css');
```

3. If that didn't work, copy [this](https://github.com/Kc5f/SchoologyGreen/blob/main/main.css) instead
